# Hurudza-Model

## Project Description

Hurudza is a project that aims to provide a solution to the problem of low agricultural output in Africa.

This idea is inspired by the Shona word "Hurudza," a Zimbabwean word meaning "super farmer."

A prospective idea that can make the world a better place insofar as farming is concerned.

These initiatives are an asset to the agricultural sector, as their benefits are of great magnitude.

## Project Insights

Nowadays, precision agriculture is a popular trend. It involves using modern farming techniques that utilize data on soil characteristics, soil types, crop yield data, weather conditions, and other factors to suggest the optimal crop to grow on a farmer's land for maximum yield and profit. This technique has the potential to reduce crop failures and enable farmers to make informed decisions about their farming strategies.

To address the current agrarian crisis, better recommendation systems are needed to assist farmers in making informed decisions before embarking on crop cultivation.

The solution is to create a digital and electronic platform that provides access to information on crops and agricultural data using a mobile application, allowing the user to monitor the weather, get information on crops, and control the irrigation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a live sourced data from our various prototypes currently in Algeria, Zimbabwe and Nigeria.

The dataset is available on Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/hurudza/hurudza-dataset>

## Project Goals

The objective is to provide farmers with recommendations for the most suitable crops to cultivate based on various parameters. This will enable them to make informed decisions before beginning the cultivation process.

Also as a solution is to create a unique model allowing farmers and all the users to monitor the weather, get information on their farms, crops, and control the irrigation.

## The project is organized into the following directories

- data: Contains the dataset files

- notebooks: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, and machine learning model development

- src: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

- results: Contains the results of the models trained in the src directory.

- resources: Contains resources on this project.

## Conclusion

Many advantages result from this approach, including enhanced crop output, less water use, increased effectiveness, and better resource management overall. Small-holder farmers, who make up the majority of the global agricultural workforce, would also have access to the platform, leveling the playing field and encouraging equitable growth.
